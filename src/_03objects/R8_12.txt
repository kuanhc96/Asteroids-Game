A class can have as many constructors as it likes, but the number of parameters passed to each of these constructors may be different. Java implements a default constructor for the programmer if none are specified, but it seldom does exactly what the programmer wants a class to do.
If a class has several constructors, the one called depends on the number of parameters that are passed to a constructor when the object is instantiated. The Constructor with no parameters needed is called when an object is instantiated without any parameters passed to the constructor; the constructor with 3 parameters is called when the object is instantiated with 3 parameters. However, in the end, regardless of which constructor is called by the client, all constructors will end up calling one "root" constructor by passing default values to this "root" constructor.
