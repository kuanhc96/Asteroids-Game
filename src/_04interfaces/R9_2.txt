The functionalities of these appliances are too different
such that if classes were to be built for each of them,
the variables assigned to each class and the methods applied
in each of them would be too different for inheritance to be useful.
In fact, inheritance in this case will cause the programmer to face
many limitations since the consistency that inheritance provides
sacrifices flexibility.
