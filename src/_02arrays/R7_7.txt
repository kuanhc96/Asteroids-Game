checked exceptions are thrown at compile time, whereas unchecked exceptions are thrown at runtime.
checked exceptions are anticipated and are handled by try-catch blocks or declared at the method header by "throws."
unchecked exceptions are thrown unexpectedly when a program runs and causes the program to fail.

for example:
public String readFile(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException {
	// this is a checked exception
	...
}

an IndexOutOfBounds Exception is an unchecked exception
