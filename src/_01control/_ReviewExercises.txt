R1.5 The following are all benefits to using Java over machine code:
1/ Java bytecode is platform independent and may be run on any system that has a JVM. This quality is known as portability.
2/ Java JIT compilers can run efficient Java programs as fast or faster than machine code programs
3/ Java is memory-managed. This reduces about 95% of runtime errors (mostly memory-related) as compared to unmanaged code.
4/ Java was designed for networking and the Internet in mind; and it is generally safer than machine code
5/ With the introduction of Java8, Java is now a declarative and functional programming language.

R2.4 
1/ s = s0 + v0 * t + 0.5 * g * Math.pow(t, 2);
2/ FV = PV * Math.pow((1 + INT / 100), YRS);
3/ G = 4 * Math.pow(Math.PI, 2) * Math.pow(a, 3) / Math.pow(p, 2) / (m1 + m2);
4/ c = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2) - 2 * a * b * Math.cos(gamma));

R2.7
a/ 8
b/ 1
c/ 17
d/ 17.5
e/ 17
f/ 18

R2.14
2 is an int
2.0 is a double
'2' is a char
"2" and "2.0" are both strings

R2.17
read user input as a string
extract first char in the string 
use for loop to loop through each char in the string
if the current char is ' ', i.e., a blank space, extract the next char in the string

R2.22
str = "SunMonTueWedThuFriSat"
       012345678901234567890
n = 4
startingPosition = 4 * 3 = 12
the 12th char in the string is T
the substring starting at position 12 with length 3 is Thu

R3.19
Read numerical grade
if grade < 60, return "F"
else if grade < 70, return "D"
else if grade < 80, return "C"
else if grade < 90, return "B"
else, return "A"

R3.30
b is false and x is 0
a/ false
b/ true
c/ true
d/ true
e/ false
f/ false
g/ false
h/ true

R4.12
for loop -- use when number of loops is known
while loop -- use when number of loops needed is unknown, but condition for which looping needs to stop is known
do-while loop -- similar to while loop, but is used when a part of a program must be executed

R4.14
print "Su M T W Th F Sa"
use for loop to loop through i = 1 to i = 31
first print blank spaces under Su, M, T on first line
if i % 7 == 1, print under W
else if i % 7 == 2, print under Th
else if i % 7 == 3, print under F
else if i % 7 == 4, print under Sa and swith to next line
else if i % 7 == 5, print under Su
else if i % 7 == 6, print under M
else, print under T
